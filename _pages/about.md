Hi

<!--This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template! 

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! -->

<!-- ## About Me
I am an alum of Sogang University, having graduated with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Computer Vision at 2025 and also previously having graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at 2023.
My previous research focuses on image retrieval and visual copy detection, as well as in the development of lightweight neural networks. Recently, I am pursuing strong interest in visual continual learning with a data-constrained environment.
