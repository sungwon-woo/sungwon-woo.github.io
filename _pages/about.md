## about me
I am an alum of Sogang University, where I earned a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Computer Vision in 2025, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at 2023.
<!-- My previous research focuses on image retrieval and visual copy detection, as well as in the development of lightweight neural networks. Recently, I am pursuing strong interest in visual continual learning with a data-constrained environment.  -->
